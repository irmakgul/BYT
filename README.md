# BYT Project – Unit Testing

**Project Overview**  
This project is developed for the BYT. 
It demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming concepts in C# and the use of Unit Testing with the NUnit framework.
The solution contains two main modules: a Geometry (Shapes) module and a Calculator module.  
Both modules are fully tested with NUnit.

## Geometry Module
-Tutorial_Shapes_Project_Code.cs – Contains IShape interface and shape classes (Sphere, Cube, Cylinder, Rectangle) 
-Tutorial_Shapes_Project_CodeForTests.cs – Additional implementations used for testing

## Calculator Module 
Calculator.cs – Performs basic arithmetic: +, -, *, /
CalculatorTests.cs – NUnit tests verifying all calculator functions 
Program.cs – Console program that runs the calculator and shows the result

## Technologies Used
- C# / .NET 8
- NUnit Framework
- Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk
- JetBrains Rider IDE
